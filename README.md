#  Wahib's Portfolio 🚀

A personal portfolio built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and supporting libraries.  
This project is designed as a **living academic record and blueprint space** — showcasing my journey as a learner, systems thinker, and builder-in-progress.

-------

## ✨ Purpose
This portfolio is not just a developer showcase.  
It serves as:
- A **CV alternative** — replacing "Work Experience" with **Ventures & Missions**, and "Skills" with **Systems Explored**.
- A **record of academic milestones** — O-Levels, AS-Levels, A-Levels, scholarships, and certificates.
- A **blueprint lab** — documenting ideas, research, and humanitarian platform concepts.
- A **collaboration space** — inviting mentors, institutions, and peers to connect.

----


###### For Developers #######
## 🎨 Design Notes
- **Style:** Minimalist, dark-mode, geometric grids.
- **Tone:** Professional but visionary — blueprint diagrams, idea maps.
- **Navigation:** One-page scroll with anchor links OR modular cards.
- **Theme:** Authentic, humble, academic.
